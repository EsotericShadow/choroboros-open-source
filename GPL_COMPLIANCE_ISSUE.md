# ⚠️ CRITICAL: GPL Compliance Issue

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your repository is named **"choroboros-open-source"** but it's **NOT actually open source licensed!**

### Current Status:
- ❌ **No GPL LICENSE file** in repository
- ❌ **No GPL headers** in source files
- ❌ **README says "Copyright © 2026 Kaizen Strategic AI Inc. All rights reserved"** (proprietary)
- ❌ **EULA.md is proprietary** (not GPL)
- ❌ **Source files have no license headers**

### What This Means:
- **You cannot claim GPL compliance** without a GPL license
- **The repo name is misleading** - it's not open source
- **You're selling proprietary software**, not GPL software

## ✅ You Have Two Options:

### Option 1: Make It Actually GPL (Recommended if you want open source)

**Steps:**
1. Add GPLv3 LICENSE file to repo root
2. Add GPL headers to all source files
3. Update README to say "Licensed under GPLv3"
4. Update EULA or remove it (GPL replaces EULA)
5. Update Gumroad description to mention GPL
6. Add SOURCE_LINK.txt to distribution ZIPs

**Pros:**
- ✅ Legally compliant with "open-source" name
- ✅ Can sell binaries (GPL allows this)
- ✅ Source available (as required by GPL)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Purple algorithms become open source (anyone can see/modify)
- ⚠️ Buyers can redistribute your binaries
- ⚠️ Must provide source to anyone who asks

### Option 2: Keep It Proprietary (Recommended if you want to protect algorithms)

**Steps:**
1. **Rename repository** to something like:
   - `choroboros-plugin`
   - `choroboros-commercial`
   - `choroboros-source` (not "open-source")
2. Update README to clarify it's proprietary
3. Remove any "open source" claims
4. Keep EULA as-is
5. Update Gumroad description (remove GPL mentions)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Protects proprietary algorithms
- ✅ Full control over distribution
- ✅ No source code disclosure required

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Can't use "open-source" in name
- ⚠️ Must be clear it's proprietary

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Since you have proprietary Purple algorithms that you want to protect**, I recommend **Option 2** (keep proprietary).

However, if you want to go GPL, I can help set that up properly.

## 📋 What You Need to Decide:

**Question:** Do you want Choroboros to be:
- **A) Open Source (GPL)** - Source code freely available, algorithms visible
- **B) Proprietary** - Source code private, algorithms protected

**Your current setup is B (proprietary), but the repo name suggests A (open source).**

## 🔧 Quick Fix (If Keeping Proprietary):

1. Rename GitHub repo (or create new one without "open-source")
2. Update README to remove "open source" claims
3. Update Gumroad description
4. Keep EULA as-is

**Which do you prefer?** I can help implement either option.
